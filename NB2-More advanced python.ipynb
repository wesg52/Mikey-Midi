Each of these take the following constraints \n",

The rows then represent pitches so a value $v$ at row $i$ and column $j$ encodes a note of pitch $i$ is played at timestep $j$ with velocity $v$. One shortcoming with this approach is that it is ambigious if $A_{ij}$ == $A_{ij+1}$ > 0 is this 2 notes or 1 long note?\n",
