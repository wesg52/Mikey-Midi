# Mikey-Midi
A python tutorial motivated by music.

We start by going through basic python concepts and work towards using music libraries in python for signal processing and working with MIDI data.

## Getting started
First we have to get your computing environment set up.

The first piece of softare you need is anaconda which is a python package and environment manager. Follow [this](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-windows) tutorial on how to install it on windows. Note, for step 6 indicate that you DO want to add anaconda to your PATH variable. VSCode is a good IDE (place to type code) so if you don't have one worth installing that too.
